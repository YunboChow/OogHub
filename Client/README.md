# OogHub

This application is insipred by the wisdom of Master Oogway and attempts to portray even a fraction of his wisdom by providing an easy and user-friendly platform to see random quotes on demand. 
It also offers the functionality to save quotes and to get more information about the authors of the quotes. 

OogHub is built with React, two APIs and two external libraries.
